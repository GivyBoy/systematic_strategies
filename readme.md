# Systematic Strategies

This repository will hold of the code of various systematic trading strategies, or research projects that I have done and will continue to do.

Firstly, ``volatility_modeling.py`` explores the concept of volatility clustering, while also using the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model, to report the mean-reverting properties of the volatility of the stock (in this case, I use the S&P500).

I will be covering a lot more stuff in the coming weeks and months, so feel free to star this repo. If you have an advice or materials, my email (``anthonygivans876@gmail.com``) is always open

I also implemented a paper that used the <a href="https://github.com/GivyBoy/CEEMDAN-and-LSTM-CNN-CBAM" target="_blank">CEEMDAN</a> algorithm, along with a stack neural network layer to predict stock prices. Feel free to check out that repo as well, along with my <a href="https://github.com/GivyBoy/quant_funcs" target="_blank">quant_funcs</a> repo. Good luck!
